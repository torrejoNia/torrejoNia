### My scientific adventure so far:

My journey as a researcher started in Peru, when I was accepted for an internship at the National Institute of Healthfollowing the completion of my bachelor’s degree. During this period, I collaborated on the design of serological and molecular diagnostic kits for Carrion’s disease, one of the oldest endemic diseases in Peru, caused by the bacterium Bartonella bacilliformis. 

At that time, I was awarded a competitive Peruvian-funded research exchange fellowship, which enabled me to carry out a research stay in Lisbon, Portugal, as one of 59 selected fellows from more than 540 applicants. I greatly enjoyed the research environment in Lisbon, which motivated me to pursue my master’s degree there, at the Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical. 

During my master’s studies, I continued working on Bartonella, and my thesis yielded interestingresults, including the detection of Bartonella DNA in approximately 20% of stray cats in the Lisbon area [(Torrejón et al., 2022).](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/11/7/749)

Before starting my PhD, I spent two years as a research fellow in the Structural Biology for Drug Discovery Lab and Merck Satellite Lab at iBET (Lisbon, Portugal), working on coupling Mass Spectrometry with Cellular Thermo Shift Assay (CETSA), which provided my initial exposure to omics data, particularly proteomics. This experience ignited my passion for computational biology and motivated me to get involved in more computational biology projects. Noteworthy, I am pleased to have contributed to my first manuscript in proteomics during this period, featuring the discovery of the ALDH2 protein as a new target for the drug Sorafenib [(Ferreira and Torrejón et al., 2024).](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2472555224000169) 

Currently, I am a PhD student at the Metabolic Diseases Research Lab (MEDIR) at NOVA Medical School (Lisbon, Portugal). My PhD thesis involves a longitudinal study on a patient cohort undergoing bariatric surgery, a procedure known to achieve not only weight loss, but also diabetes resolution. I am focusing on characterizing the molecular content of circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) pre-and post-surgery. By analysing EVs molecular changes, we will gain mechanistic insights that could explain 
the metabolic improvements observed following the procedure. This project is conducted under the lab's BIOMET project, which already received ethics approval. We have already recruited the patients, collected the samples, and are currently isolating the EVs 
for proteomics analysis.

Simultaneously, I have contributed to a parallel project investigating the impact of the oral antidiabetic drugs, metformin and pioglitazone, on the proteome and lipidome of gut-derived EVs isolated from a prediabetic mouse model. Upon joining the lab, I wrote and implemented a pipeline for proteomics analysis, specifically for differential abundance analysis based on intensity-based 
absolute quantification (iBAQ) values and comparative gene ontology data visualization. The results were presented at the International Society of Computational Biology Student Council Symposium 2023 (ISCB-SCS2023) and the main event 
(ISMBECCB2023) in Lyon, France (Torrejón and Teshima et al., 2023a), for which I received a travel fellowship from the ISCB. 

Additionally, I adapted this pipeline for analysis of untreated prediabetic mice gut-derived EVs, with the goal of highlighting changes in post-translational modifications, leading to a recent publication, in where I am listed as the second co-author [(Baptista Pereira et al., 2024).](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/5/736)

Next, I focused on integrating proteomics and lipidomics data to identify correlations between proteins associated with lipid metabolism and the identified lipid species. To that end, I used the multiblock sPLS-DA integration method embedded in the R package mixOmics. The preliminary findings of this work were presented at the RECOMB 2024 conference in Boston, USA, for which I have received a travel fellowship from the Twinning project Extracellular Vesicles in Clinical Applications, EVCA
(HORIZON GA n°101079264).

During my second year of PhD, I won an EMBO scientific exchange grant to develop the project “Deciphering the Gut-to-Kupffer Cell Communication Network mediated by Gut-Derived Extracellular Vesicles”, which was carried out in collaboration with the  SystemsBiomedicine lab led by Anaïs Baudot from the Marseille Medical Genetics Research Center in France. As the outcome, we not only uncover the gut-liver interaction mediated by EVs but also created a framework applicable to other EVs proteomic and transcriptomics datasets, facilitating the study of additional long-distance cell to cell interactions mediated by these vesicles. This framework is currently being tailored as a Bioconductor bioinformatics tool called [EV-Net](https://torrejonia.github.io/EV-Net/). We aim to submit an application note featuring EV-Net in the first quarter of 2026.

Overall, my journey as a PhD student has been marked by significant progress across various projects, setting a strong foundation for uncovering the novel insights into the role of EVs in metabolic diseases and working with different computational biology methodologies, establishing a promising trajectory for my future research endeavours.
